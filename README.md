#City of Austin Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows


The code and formatting of this site is forked from [NYC Tech Jobs](http://www.nyc.gov/techjobs).

##Website Framework

The website is built on [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), an extremely easy-to-use HTML/CSS/JS framework. We're also using form styling from the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/), and additional styling from the [CFPB Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/).

##Use it for Your City!

We (and NYC) want you to use or modify this website for your city. If you're GitHub-savvy, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or [NYC's repo](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/TechJobs) for your organization. If you just want to download the code as a ZIP file, click Download ZIP at the bottom of the right-hand navigation bar.

Either way, shoot a note to dseliger@cto.nyc.gov and innovationfellows@austintexas.gov
